# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an algorithmic trading platform that allows users to create custom trading constraints and monitor portfolio performance against the US stock market. Users can define trigger points for automated buy/sell decisions, track their portfolio's performance, and compare it against market benchmarks. The platform will integrate with stock market APIs to provide real-time data and execute trading logic based on user-defined rules.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to create custom trading constraints with percentage-based triggers, so that I can automate my buy/sell decisions based on predefined rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new constraint THEN the system SHALL allow them to specify stock symbol, buy trigger percentage, sell trigger percentage, and trade amounts
2. WHEN a stock price drops by the specified percentage THEN the system SHALL trigger a buy signal for the specified amount
3. WHEN a stock price rises by the specified percentage THEN the system SHALL trigger a sell signal for the specified amount
4. WHEN a stock rises by a profit percentage from the buying price THEN the system SHALL trigger a sell signal regardless of other constraints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to view my portfolio performance in real-time, so that I can monitor how my algorithmic trading strategy is performing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their portfolio dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current portfolio value, total gains/losses, and individual stock positions
2. WHEN portfolio data is updated THEN the system SHALL refresh the display within 30 seconds
3. WHEN a user views a specific stock position THEN the system SHALL show purchase price, current price, quantity, and profit/loss percentage
4. WHEN the system calculates portfolio performance THEN it SHALL include realized and unrealized gains/losses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to compare my portfolio performance against market benchmarks, so that I can evaluate the effectiveness of my trading strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views portfolio performance THEN the system SHALL display comparison against S&P 500 index
2. WHEN calculating performance comparison THEN the system SHALL show percentage difference between portfolio and market performance
3. WHEN displaying performance metrics THEN the system SHALL include time-based comparisons (1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 1 year)
4. WHEN market data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and use cached data if available

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to manage multiple trading constraints for different stocks, so that I can diversify my algorithmic trading strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates multiple constraints THEN the system SHALL allow unlimited constraint creation per user account
2. WHEN constraints conflict for the same stock THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most recently created constraint
3. WHEN a user edits a constraint THEN the system SHALL update the constraint immediately and apply it to future price movements
4. WHEN a user deletes a constraint THEN the system SHALL remove it from active monitoring but preserve historical trade data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to receive real-time stock market data, so that my trading constraints can be evaluated against current market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system monitors stock prices THEN it SHALL update price data at least every 60 seconds during market hours
2. WHEN market data is received THEN the system SHALL evaluate all active constraints for affected stocks
3. WHEN an API call fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
4. IF API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL queue requests and process them when limits reset

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to view my trading history and constraint triggers, so that I can analyze the performance of my algorithmic trading rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a constraint triggers a trade signal THEN the system SHALL log the trigger event with timestamp, stock symbol, trigger type, and price
2. WHEN a user views trading history THEN the system SHALL display all triggered events in chronological order
3. WHEN analyzing constraint performance THEN the system SHALL show success rate and profit/loss for each constraint type
4. WHEN exporting trading data THEN the system SHALL provide CSV format with all relevant trade information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to simulate my trading constraints on historical data, so that I can test my strategy before applying it to real trading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new constraint THEN the system SHALL offer backtesting against historical data
2. WHEN running a backtest THEN the system SHALL simulate constraint triggers using historical price data for the specified time period
3. WHEN backtest completes THEN the system SHALL display projected performance, number of trades, and profit/loss analysis
4. WHEN comparing backtest results THEN the system SHALL show performance against buy-and-hold strategy for the same period
