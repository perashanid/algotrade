# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The trading platform is experiencing significant performance issues due to excessive database calls and inefficient data fetching patterns. Users are experiencing slow page loads and delayed responses when viewing portfolios, constraints, and dashboard data. The current architecture makes multiple sequential database calls for related data, lacks proper caching mechanisms, and doesn't utilize database optimization techniques like connection pooling, query batching, or data aggregation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to load quickly (under 2 seconds), so that I can efficiently monitor my portfolio and trading constraints without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads the dashboard THEN the system SHALL complete all data loading within 2 seconds
2. WHEN displaying portfolio data THEN the system SHALL fetch all position data in a single optimized query
3. WHEN loading constraint groups THEN the system SHALL use batch queries to minimize database round trips
4. WHEN calculating portfolio metrics THEN the system SHALL use database aggregation functions instead of client-side calculations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want constraint position data to load instantly when switching between views, so that I can quickly analyze different constraint groups without waiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching between constraint views THEN the system SHALL serve cached data when available
2. WHEN constraint data is updated THEN the system SHALL invalidate relevant cache entries automatically
3. WHEN loading constraint positions THEN the system SHALL use a single query with joins instead of multiple sequential queries
4. WHEN displaying group data THEN the system SHALL pre-aggregate stock counts and values at the database level

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time price updates to be efficient and not slow down the application, so that I can see current market data without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating stock prices THEN the system SHALL batch price updates into single transactions
2. WHEN fetching current prices THEN the system SHALL use in-memory caching with appropriate TTL
3. WHEN multiple users request the same stock data THEN the system SHALL serve from cache to reduce API calls
4. WHEN price data is stale THEN the system SHALL refresh cache in background without blocking user requests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized database queries and connection management, so that the system can handle increased load without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing database queries THEN the system SHALL use prepared statements and query optimization
2. WHEN managing database connections THEN the system SHALL implement proper connection pooling with appropriate limits
3. WHEN performing bulk operations THEN the system SHALL use batch inserts/updates instead of individual queries
4. WHEN querying related data THEN the system SHALL use JOIN operations instead of N+1 query patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the frontend to efficiently manage API calls and data updates, so that the interface remains responsive during data operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading multiple data sources THEN the frontend SHALL make parallel API calls instead of sequential calls
2. WHEN data is already loaded THEN the frontend SHALL avoid redundant API requests
3. WHEN updating data THEN the frontend SHALL use optimistic updates where appropriate
4. WHEN displaying lists THEN the frontend SHALL implement virtual scrolling for large datasets

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive performance monitoring and caching strategies, so that I can identify and resolve performance bottlenecks proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN queries execute THEN the system SHALL log query execution times and identify slow queries
2. WHEN cache hit/miss occurs THEN the system SHALL track cache performance metrics
3. WHEN database connections are used THEN the system SHALL monitor connection pool utilization
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide alerts and diagnostic information
