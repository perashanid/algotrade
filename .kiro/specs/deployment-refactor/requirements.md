# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This refactoring project aims to resolve deployment issues where the dashboard appears briefly after login then goes blank, while the application works correctly in local development. The refactoring will remove unnecessary performance monitoring, caching, and other non-essential code that may be causing deployment conflicts or client-side rendering issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to load and remain visible after login in production, so that I can access the application functionality consistently across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the dashboard SHALL remain visible and functional in production
2. WHEN the application loads in production THEN it SHALL behave identically to local development
3. WHEN the dashboard renders THEN it SHALL not disappear or go blank after initial display
4. IF there are environment-specific issues THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without breaking the UI

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unnecessary performance monitoring code, so that the application has a cleaner codebase and fewer potential points of failure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance monitoring code is removed THEN the core application functionality SHALL remain intact
2. WHEN slow request detection is removed THEN API responses SHALL continue to work normally
3. WHEN cache clearing mechanisms are removed THEN data fetching SHALL still function correctly
4. IF performance monitoring was causing deployment issues THEN removing it SHALL resolve those issues

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unnecessary caching mechanisms, so that the application has simpler data flow and fewer potential race conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN caching services are removed THEN data SHALL be fetched directly from appropriate sources
2. WHEN cache clearing is removed THEN the application SHALL not have stale data issues
3. WHEN simplified data flow is implemented THEN API calls SHALL be more predictable
4. IF caching was causing blank dashboard issues THEN removing it SHALL fix the problem

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and remove any code that differs between local and production behavior, so that the application behaves consistently across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment-specific code is identified THEN it SHALL be either removed or made consistent
2. WHEN production builds are created THEN they SHALL not include development-only features
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL not depend on local-only configurations
4. IF there are build-time differences THEN they SHALL be resolved to ensure consistency

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Vercel configuration files to be optimized for deployment, so that the application deploys successfully without environment-specific issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Vercel configuration is reviewed THEN it SHALL be optimized for the current project structure
2. WHEN build settings are configured THEN they SHALL work correctly for both frontend and backend components
3. WHEN environment variables are set THEN they SHALL be properly configured for production deployment
4. WHEN API routes are configured THEN they SHALL be properly mapped in the Vercel deployment
5. IF there are Vercel-specific deployment issues THEN the configuration SHALL be updated to resolve them

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript errors to be resolved before deployment, so that the build process completes successfully on Vercel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN it SHALL complete without any type errors
2. WHEN the build process executes THEN it SHALL not fail due to TypeScript issues
3. WHEN type definitions are checked THEN they SHALL be consistent across all modules
4. WHEN strict TypeScript settings are applied THEN the code SHALL comply with all type requirements
5. IF there are deployment-specific TypeScript errors THEN they SHALL be identified and resolved

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all redundant code and files to be removed, so that the codebase is clean and deployment bundle size is optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN redundant files are identified THEN they SHALL be removed from the project
2. WHEN duplicate code is found THEN it SHALL be consolidated or eliminated
3. WHEN unused imports are detected THEN they SHALL be removed from all files
4. WHEN dead code is identified THEN it SHALL be removed while preserving functionality
5. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the codebase SHALL have no unnecessary files or code

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing functionality to work after the refactoring, so that no features are lost during the cleanup process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all authentication functionality SHALL work as before
2. WHEN users access portfolio features THEN they SHALL function identically to the original implementation
3. WHEN constraint management is used THEN it SHALL maintain all existing capabilities
4. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL return the same data and responses as before
5. IF any functionality is modified THEN it SHALL only be to remove non-essential monitoring or caching code
