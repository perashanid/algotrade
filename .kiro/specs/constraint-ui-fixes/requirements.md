# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical UI functionality issues across the constraints management system and dashboard. Users are experiencing problems with delete buttons not working, missing add button functionality, missing dropdown displays for stocks in groups, and issues with removal/edit trigger sections in both the main constraints page and dashboard components. Additionally, the "AlgoTrader" logo/text in the top left navigation should provide a way to return to the homepage. These problems prevent users from effectively managing their trading constraints and navigating the application, impacting the core functionality of the portfolio management system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want the delete button to work properly for constraints and constraint groups, so that I can remove unwanted trading rules from my system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the delete button on an individual constraint THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation dialog
2. WHEN I confirm the deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the constraint from the database and update the UI immediately
3. WHEN I click the delete button on a constraint group THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation dialog with the group name
4. WHEN I confirm the constraint group deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the group and all associated data from the database
5. IF the delete operation fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want functional add buttons throughout the constraint interface, so that I can easily add new stocks, constraints, and groups to my trading system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am in the constraint groups view THEN the system SHALL display a clearly visible "Add Stock" button for each group
2. WHEN I click the "Add Stock" button THEN the system SHALL display a stock search input with autocomplete functionality
3. WHEN I select a stock from the search THEN the system SHALL add it to the group and refresh the display
4. WHEN I am in the stock groups view THEN the system SHALL display a "New Stock Group" button that creates new stock groupings
5. IF an add operation fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and not modify the UI state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want to see a dropdown or expandable list showing all stocks in each group, so that I can quickly review and manage the stocks within my constraint groups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a constraint group THEN the system SHALL display an expandable section showing all stocks in that group
2. WHEN I click to expand a group THEN the system SHALL show each stock with its current trigger settings
3. WHEN a group contains stock groups THEN the system SHALL display stocks from both individual stocks and stock group memberships
4. WHEN a group has no stocks THEN the system SHALL display a helpful message indicating the group is empty
5. WHEN I expand a group THEN the system SHALL show the total count of stocks in the group header

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want functional edit and removal controls for individual stocks within groups, so that I can customize trigger settings and remove stocks that no longer fit my strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view stocks within a constraint group THEN the system SHALL display edit and remove buttons for each stock
2. WHEN I click the edit button for a stock THEN the system SHALL display inline editing controls for trigger percentages and amounts
3. WHEN I modify trigger values and save THEN the system SHALL update the stock's individual overrides and refresh the display
4. WHEN I click the remove button for a stock THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation dialog with the stock symbol
5. WHEN I confirm stock removal THEN the system SHALL remove the stock from the group and update the display immediately
6. IF edit or removal operations fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and revert any UI changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want the same constraint management functionality to work consistently in both the main constraints page and the dashboard constraints summary, so that I can manage my trading rules from any location in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view constraints in the dashboard summary THEN the system SHALL display the same edit, delete, and add functionality as the main constraints page
2. WHEN I perform operations in the dashboard constraints section THEN the system SHALL behave identically to the main constraints page
3. WHEN I make changes in either location THEN the system SHALL update both views to maintain consistency
4. WHEN I encounter issues in one view THEN the system SHALL ensure the same functionality works in both locations
5. IF operations fail in either view THEN the system SHALL display consistent error handling and messaging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click on the "AlgoTrader" logo or text in the top navigation to return to the homepage, so that I can easily navigate back to the main dashboard from any page in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on the "AlgoTrader" text or logo in the top left navigation THEN the system SHALL navigate me to the homepage/dashboard
2. WHEN I hover over the "AlgoTrader" element THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating it is clickable
3. WHEN I am on any page in the application THEN the "AlgoTrader" navigation element SHALL be consistently available and functional

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform any CRUD operation on constraints or groups THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback

3. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and maintain the previous UI state
4. WHEN I navigate between different constraint views THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent button placement and functionality
5. WHEN I interact with any button or control THEN the system SHALL respond within 200ms with visual feedback
