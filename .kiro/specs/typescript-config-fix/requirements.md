# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The backend TypeScript compilation is failing due to missing Node.js type definitions and incomplete Express request interface extensions. This feature will resolve all TypeScript compilation errors by properly configuring type definitions and ensuring all Node.js and Express types are correctly recognized throughout the codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TypeScript compilation to succeed without errors, so that I can build and deploy the backend application reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TypeScript compiler runs THEN it SHALL complete without any type errors related to Node.js globals
2. WHEN the TypeScript compiler runs THEN it SHALL complete without any type errors related to Express request properties
3. WHEN importing Node.js modules like 'path' THEN the compiler SHALL recognize these modules without errors
4. WHEN using Node.js globals like `process` and `__dirname` THEN the compiler SHALL recognize these without errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AuthRequest interface to properly extend Express Request, so that all standard Express request properties are available in authenticated routes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using AuthRequest in controllers THEN the interface SHALL provide access to `req.body` property
2. WHEN using AuthRequest in controllers THEN the interface SHALL provide access to `req.params` property  
3. WHEN using AuthRequest in controllers THEN the interface SHALL provide access to `req.query` property
4. WHEN using AuthRequest in controllers THEN the interface SHALL provide access to `req.headers` property
5. WHEN using AuthRequest in middleware THEN the interface SHALL provide access to `req.method` and `req.path` properties

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript module resolution, so that all imports work correctly across the backend codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing Node.js built-in modules THEN the TypeScript compiler SHALL resolve them correctly
2. WHEN using ES module syntax with CommonJS modules THEN the compiler SHALL handle the interop correctly
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL generate clean JavaScript output without type errors
