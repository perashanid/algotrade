# Design Document

## Overview

The TypeScript compilation errors are caused by two main issues:
1. The TypeScript configuration is not properly including Node.js types in the compilation context
2. There's a conflict between the global Express Request interface extension and the local AuthRequest interface

The solution involves updating the TypeScript configuration to properly include Node.js types and consolidating the Express Request interface extensions to use the global declaration pattern consistently.

## Architecture

### Current State Analysis
- `@types/node` is installed but not being recognized by the compiler
- The `tsconfig.json` includes `"DOM"` in the lib array, which can conflict with Node.js types
- There are two different approaches to extending Express Request: global declaration in `global.d.ts` and local interface extension in `auth.ts`
- The `typeRoots` configuration may be interfering with automatic type resolution

### Target State
- Single, consistent approach to Express Request interface extension using global declarations
- Proper TypeScript configuration that recognizes Node.js built-in modules and globals
- Clean compilation without type errors

## Components and Interfaces

### TypeScript Configuration Updates
**File:** `backend/tsconfig.json`
- Remove `"DOM"` from lib array to prevent conflicts with Node.js types
- Add `"node"` to the types array to explicitly include Node.js types
- Ensure proper module resolution for Node.js built-ins

### Global Type Definitions Consolidation
**File:** `backend/src/types/global.d.ts`
- Extend the existing global Express Request interface to include all required properties
- Remove redundant AuthRequest interface from middleware files
- Ensure all Express request properties are properly typed

### Middleware Interface Updates
**File:** `backend/src/middleware/auth.ts`
- Remove local AuthRequest interface definition
- Use the global Express.Request interface directly
- Maintain type safety for the user property through global declaration

## Data Models

### Express Request Extension
```typescript
declare global {
  namespace Express {
    interface Request {
      user?: {
        id: string;
        email: string;
      };
    }
  }
}
```

This global declaration will make all Express Request objects have the optional user property, eliminating the need for a separate AuthRequest interface.

## Error Handling

### Compilation Error Resolution
1. **Node.js Module Resolution**: Update tsconfig to properly resolve Node.js built-in modules
2. **Global Type Conflicts**: Remove DOM types that conflict with Node.js environment
3. **Interface Conflicts**: Consolidate to single global interface extension approach

### Type Safety Maintenance
- Ensure all existing functionality continues to work after interface changes
- Maintain strict typing for user authentication properties
- Preserve IntelliSense and type checking capabilities

## Testing Strategy

### Compilation Verification
1. Run `npm run build` to verify TypeScript compilation succeeds
2. Check that all Node.js globals (`process`, `__dirname`) are recognized
3. Verify that all Express request properties are available in controllers

### Runtime Verification
1. Ensure authentication middleware continues to work correctly
2. Verify that all controller methods can access request properties
3. Test that the application starts and runs without runtime errors

### Type Checking Validation
1. Verify IntelliSense works correctly in IDE
2. Check that type errors are properly caught during development
3. Ensure no regression in type safety
